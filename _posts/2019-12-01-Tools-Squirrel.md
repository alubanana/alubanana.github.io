## Project Description

Hunt A Squirrel is a web application that can keep track of all the known squirrels in Central Park. Through Hunt A Squirrel, we can see a map that displays the location of the squirrel sightings. Information about whether a squirrel is eating, running, etc. is also available. In a word, no matter how you feel about squirrels, love them or afraid of them, want to see them or avoid them, this web application is exactly what you are looking for.

## Background

Joffrey Hosencratz, the new owner of our company, fancies the show Rick and Morty and a particular scene coupled with a traumatic childhood squirrel experience and a bad crystal bath experience in Sedona as left him wanting. He would like to start keeping track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park.
