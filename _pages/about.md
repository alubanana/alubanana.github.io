I am technically sophisticated with talent for problem-solving and demonstrated abilities in programming and prescriptive modeling by utilizing a range of statistical and machine learning methods.

Well-positioned to apply my education and experience for the benefit of my employer, I look forward to building on my real-world experience as an employee, where I can be molded into a valuable asset and key resource in my professional environment with the guidance and mentorship of my leadership team and senior coworkers. In the past, associates have found me to be a highly-motivated and productive collaborator yet I also take pride in my singular accomplishments â€“ all are detailed here within my LinkedIn profile.

I would welcome the opportunity to connect with other professionals for networking and/or exploring employment opportunities.
