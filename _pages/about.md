I am technically sophisticated with talent for problem-solving and demonstrated abilities in **Programming** and **Modeling** by utilizing a range of **Statistical** and **Machine Learning** methods.

Well-positioned to apply my education and experience for the benefit of my employer, I look forward to building on my real-world experience as an employee, where I can be molded into a valuable asset and key resource in my professional environment with the guidance and mentorship of my leadership team and senior coworkers. In the past, associates have found me to be a highly-motivated and productive collaborator yet I also take pride in my singular accomplishments â€“ All are detailed here within my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annan-chen-1227b5138/) profile and my [Resume](https://github.com/alubanana/alubanana.github.io/blob/main/resume/Resume_Annan.pdf). 

I would welcome the opportunity to connect with other professionals for networking and/or exploring employment opportunities.
